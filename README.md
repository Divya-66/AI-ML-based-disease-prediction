Real-time AI-powered health monitoring system that predicts **Diabetes Risk** and **Heart Disease Risk** using everyday wearable data:  
Blood Glucose · Heart Rate · SpO₂ · Steps · Sleep Duration & Quality · Workouts · Stress Levels

Live Demo (coming soon): [https://healthguard-ai.streamlit.app](https://healthguard-ai.streamlit.app)

### Project Goal

To build a **proactive, personalized health assistant** that:
- Detects early signs of **hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia**
- Predicts **cardiovascular risk** (arrhythmia, hypertension, heart strain)
- Analyzes **lifestyle patterns** from smartwatches/fitness bands
- Delivers **actionable, personalized wellness recommendations** in real time

> From raw wearable data to life-saving insights — no doctor visit required.

### Sample Personalized Output

> **You belong to Cluster 4 – "Night Owls with High Glucose Variability"**  
> **Diabetes Risk**: Moderate (75th percentile)  
> **Heart Risk**: Elevated resting HR detected  
> **Recommendations**:  
> - Eat dinner 3+ hours before bed  
> - 20-min walk after meals  
> - Aim for 7.5+ hours sleep before 12 AM  
> - Monitor SpO₂ during sleep (possible apnea)
